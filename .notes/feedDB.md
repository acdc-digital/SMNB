What if for the host agent- instead of displaying the response, we just have a huge markdown text editor?

1- maybe for later: Then, we can implement like real-typewriting editing- maybe if it's more like a canvas*

anyways, the text editor will just update the news in real time, and just cascase down the page. We can export to the database in like a cleaned up json every so often?

----- then, the producer could add sources to the stories via background api search. The Producer could just be APIs looking for relevant content from a variety of sources. 

were not chat-we're news.
